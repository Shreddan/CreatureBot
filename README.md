# CreatureBot
My implementation of a project originally created by garethhubball His project can be found here https://github.com/garethhubball/CppTwitchSoundBot


First of all in order for this to work you will have to create a new twitch account for your Bot
and then go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to obtain the bots Oauth pass

then in Twitch0AuthToken.txt add the bot Oauth code ex. oauth:sdiijsdbfjsbf3432
On the line below that your bots username in lower case.
Below that the name channel to connect to (your Twitch username)
and then finally the name of the window written exactly as it is on the titlebar (i added this feature as then it can be used by different versions and hopefully still work)

save the file and the program should run fine
(Make sure to Run the program with adminstrator privileges so it can fully access the windows API)
