# CreatureBot
My implementation of a project originally created by garethhubball His project can be found here https://github.com/garethhubball/CppTwitchSoundBot


First of all in order for this to work you will have to create a new twitch account for your Bot
and then go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to obtain the bots Oauth pass

then in Twitch0AuthToken.txt add the bot Oauth code ex. oauth:sdiijsdbfjsbf3432
then underneath that your bots username in lower case save the file and the program should run fine
(Make sure to Run the program with adminstrator privileges so it can fully access the windows API)
